# Steel Yield and Ultimate Tensile Strength Prediction Tool (SYLTSPtool)

This Python tool predicts the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of steel based on its chemical composition. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of steel samples with known properties.



# Features:

Predicts YS and UTS for unseen steel compositions.
Provides user-friendly interface for input and output.
Leverages a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.

# Installation:
