# Steel Yield and Ultimate Tensile Strength Prediction Tool (SYLTSPtool)

This Python tool predicts the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of steel based on its chemical composition. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of steel samples with known properties.



# Features:

Predicts YS and UTS for unseen steel compositions.
Provides user-friendly interface for input and output.
Leverages a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.

# Installation:


1-Downalod code.py 
2-Change the data file(csv) name of on code
3-run the codes by making sure that the file and data file on the same direcotry = code.py filena,e.csv
